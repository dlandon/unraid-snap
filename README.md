SNAP for unRAID Server

Snap: Share Non-Array Partitions 

Adding storage devices to an unRAID server without them being part of the unRAID array. Adding a device to SNAP means that it's filesystem will be mounted to make it available in linux and shared out to make it available on the network. SNAP is aware of the unRAID array drives and doesn't disturb them.
